Q1. Consider given code,
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        int c=a+b;
        printf("c = %d\n", c);
        return 0;
    }
   
    Show preprocessed output file with filename "preprocessedcode.txt" generated by C compiler along with Makefile (point penalty for adding extra commands other than necessary).
